# Web3 Portfolio Dashboard (UI Showcase)

This repository contains the **Frontend Source Code** for my personal Web3 Portfolio dApp. 
It demonstrates modern UI/UX patterns in blockchain development, including interactive animations and wallet integration.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js (App Router)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Web3**: Wagmi, Viem, RainbowKit
- **Auth**: SIWE (Sign-In with Ethereum)

## ⚠️ Note on Architecture
To ensure security and operational integrity, the backend logic (Gasless Relayer, Budget System, and Private Keys) is hosted in a separate **private repository**. 
This public repo serves as a technical showcase of the client-side implementation.
